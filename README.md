## My process

### Built with

- MongoDB
- bcrypt
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - For Form validatiion
- [DnD Kit](https://dndkit.com/) - For Drag and Drop
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) - For Authentication

### What I learned

Drag and Drop was something new for me so I struggled a bit with it but later got things up and running. In general it was
a great experience for me to be able to implement drag and drop functionality using DnD kit.
